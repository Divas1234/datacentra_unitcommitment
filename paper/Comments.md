REQUIRED: Comments to the Author:
This paper has been reviewed by three experts in this field. The topic is timely and the structure is clear, but several issues should be addressed. The distinction between inter-cluster load balancing and intra-cluster DVFS control needs clearer explanation. The contribution and novelty should be emphasized in the introduction. Figures and units should be standardized. The modeling section requires brief clarification of SOS-1 and McCormick methods, and runtime comparison should be added to show feasibility. The role of DCCs in frequency response should be further discussed, and the manuscript needs careful proofreading.

The manuscript received gives a modified UC that considers the flexibility potential produced by data centers. The DVFS control scheme is extended to address the detailed demand consumption from data centers. The mentioned topic is timely and relevant, my questions are listed below,

1. It is recommended to provide an overall description of the proposed research framework before the discussion of the proposed method.

2. The contributions to this work should be highlighted and given clearly explanations in the introduction section.

3. It seems that the DVFS-controlled behind data center clusters is a novel point in this work. It is recommended to provide more description and discussions about the control logic in the DVFS-controlled data center clusters.

4. Figure.8 and figure.11 compares the voltage and power consumption of DCCs under different redistribution intervals. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how the voltage and power consumption of DCCs are affected by the redistribution intervals. It is suggested to provide more detailed explanations in the main text.

This paper discusses the application of data center clusters through DVFS-based control in the operation process of power systems. The extended UC model considering DVFS-controlled DCCs is compared with existing literature, and the results seem promising. However, there are several issues that need improvement:

1. Supplementing the running time is suggested to further verify the feasibility of the proposed method in near real-time scheduling.

1. The McCormick envelops technique is applied to linearize the bilinear terms when modeling the DVFS-controlled DCCs. It is suggested to add the runtime and GPU memory consumption of the proposed method in comparison with benchmark.
2. In the section. II, please provide a high-level description about SOS-1 constraints before deriving the operations constraints of DVFS-controlled DCCs. Availability, a simplified illustrative example (possibly with a two-variable case or graphical explanation) would significantly improve accessibility for readers.
3. It is suggested to add a detailed description of the workload balancing and DVFS control strategy, the difference between these two physical processes is also suggested to be explained.
4. Some abbreviations (such as "UC" and "BESS") do not provide complete definitions when they first appear in the context (although they are implicitly defined in the abstract). It is suggested to add a complete description of the abbreviations in the nomenclature section.
5. The manuscript contains several grammatical and typographical errors (e.g., “shut-up/shut-down” should be “start-up/shut-down”). A thorough proofreading or professional English editing service is recommended.

This manuscript extends a DCC-constrained UC model to analyze the flexible capabilities of large-scale DCCs through DVFS control scheme. The topic is interesting and timely, and the structure of the entire manuscript is well organized, but the settings of case studies need to be improved, and my concerns are listed below.

1.It is recommended to clearly distinguish between the effects of load balancing processes across multi DCCs and the detailed DVFS control scheme hosted within individual DCC in this paper, and a more high-level explanation describing these two processes would be better for enhancing readability.
2.The contribution should be highlighted, and the significance of this work differs from existing relevant studies be added in the introduction section.
3.The coordinate axis labels and unit descriptions in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, can be further clarified and standardized to ensure accuracy and ease of interpretation.
4.The support benefits from DCCs are reflected through power balance and frequency control, the authors are encouraged to elaborate on the role and significance of DCCs in frequency dynamic response. This would better emphasize their practical importance.
